Early birds can stake their LP tokens right now!

## Tutorials

### 1. Add liquidity to Uniswap

In order to receive LP mining rewards, you'll need to provide liquidity on the [OCTO-USDC pool on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x1B87FDE6aF5396165fdADf7f532784622A824Abf). A tutorial on how to do so can be found [here](https://den.octo.fi/d/114-how-to-add-liquidity-to-uniswap-liquidity-pool).

### 2. Stake LP tokens on UniCrypt

Once liquidity has been provided, you'll need to [stake your tokens on Unicrypt](https://farm.unicrypt.network/farms?token=0x7240aC91f01233BaAf8b064248E80feaA5912BA3). A step-by-step tutorial can also be found [here](https://octo.fi/blog/liquidity-provider-rewards-are-here).

### 3. Harvest OCTO

You can harvest your $OCTO rewards at any time by clicking "Harvest" on the pool. While LP tokens can also be withdrawn at any time, the pool will run for 2 full months, which will give all token holders the opportunity to earn inky rewards for a long time until the program ends on

When you've earned rewards you will have the option to withdraw them. This initial program runs for 2 months, so give your aquafarm time to grow those tasty little tenties and withdraw your OCTO at the end of the program.

Please note: While farming you don't get platform fees, but you'll harvest some OCTO and also earn fees as a liquidity provider.

More news and incentive programs of all kinds are coming, so keep your eyes peeled for more updates!
