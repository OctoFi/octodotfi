### Tutorial

_You must have equal parts OCTO and USDC before you begin._

#### 1. Add liquidity to Uniswap

To earn LP rewards you must first add liquidity to the [OCTO-USDC pool on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x1B87FDE6aF5396165fdADf7f532784622A824Abf). If you're not familiar with the process you can check [our tutorial](https://den.octo.fi/d/114-how-to-add-liquidity-to-uniswap-liquidity-pool).

#### 2. Stake LP tokens on UniCrypt

Start by visiting our [OCTO Farm](https://farm.unicrypt.network/farms?token=0x7240aC91f01233BaAf8b064248E80feaA5912BA3) and accepting the welcome message. Then click on the "Farm OCTO" tile and click on "Connect your wallet".

Select your preferred wallet and connect to it as normal, then click on the "Farm OCTO" tile again and you will see your UNIv2 tokens (LP tokens) available to stake. Click on the "Stake" button to proceed.

Once approved you will be able to see the OCTO-USDC liquidity you are staking, along with your share of the pool, and the options to add more liquidity or withdraw from staking.

#### 3. Harvest OCTO 

When you've earned rewards you will have the option to withdraw them. This initial program runs for 2 months, so give your aquafarm time to grow those tasty little tenties and withdraw your OCTO at the end of the program on March 28 at 8:08am UTC.

> _Please note: While farming you donâ€™t get platform fees, but you'll harvest some OCTO and also earn fees as a liquidity provider. Striking a balance during early stages of #Feebruary and beyond._

Wanna share our farm? You can use [farm.octo.fi](https://farm.octo.fi) as short URL that takes you directly there.

It ain't much, but it's honest worktopus.

Kind regardacles, 

Dr. Octavius
