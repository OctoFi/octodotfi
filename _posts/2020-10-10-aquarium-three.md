We want to keep going with our aquarium transparency reports in an effort to provide full transparency for the actions of OctoFi. 

Since the token deployment on 17 August 2020, we've been providing the following comprehensive details on token holdings and use of tokens to date. 

We will provide transparency reports on a monthly basis going forward.

## Yield Wallet

| Reason | Spend | Amount |
|-|-|-|
| [Initial funds][2] | [0x4276...2d202e][3] | 200,000 OCTO |
| Yield Txs | [0xb51d...9135c0][14] | 686 OCTO |

**Total balance:**

- 199,314 

You will notice that the two largest holders equate to 56.97% of the total 800k supply. These combined holdings actually belong to the community in the form of:

- **Project Reserve:** budget allocation that community will spend based on governance proposals and voting [as detailed here](https://octo.fi/blog/project-reserve)
- **Interest Program:** allocated to interest yielding contract split evenly between runtime payouts and airdrop rewards [as explained in detail here](https://octo.fi/blog/interest-pool) (Another OIP will decide of the usage of the left over from Yield Wallet) 

Community governance is a major focus for the OctoFi project and as such we will be encouraging proposals and voting. 

Best greetings from Dr. Octavius
