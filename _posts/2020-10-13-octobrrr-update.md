#### Hotbit Listed OCTO

As a special gift to the community, to get things rolling and dip our tentacles into the deep blue CeFi, the team pooled together some personal funds to get listed along with a comprehensive promo package.

#### Dedicated Memes Website

We have been so impressed with the community's memes that we wanted to collect them and put them on display. We've also been playing around with the idea of making our memes into NFTs and directing any proceeds from their sale back into the community.

#### Decentralized Fashion Tentacles

Merchandise is coming for DeFi, tentacles and all. The store isn't yet accepting orders, but we are in discussions with an active octonaut to take it on and make it completely community-run. You'll be able to pay with ETH, USDC, and of course OCTO. The store is also decentralized, running on IPFS with the purposebuilt platform from Origin Protocol.

If you are not sure what Kleros is all about, we highly recommend you [read this article of theirs](http://blog.kleros.io/erc20-becomes-part-of-the-token/) to understand what opportunities this inclusion opens up for OCTO in future.
