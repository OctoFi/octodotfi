In an effort to provide full transparency for the actions of OctoFi, since the token deployment on 17 August 2020, we are providing the following comprehensive details on token holdings and use of tokens to date.

Since deployment, we have completed several actions and moved a few tokens from the deployer address, which we want to keep transparent. We will also provide transparency reports on a monthly basis going forward. To that end, this is our first transparency report, and covers the period from first deployment on August 17 through September 11, 2020.

**Use of tokens to date**

The total 800,000 OCTO supply is allocated as follows:

**Bonding curve:** 125,000 OCTO for public sale commencing 14 September 2020 at 00:00 UTC as per the [details here.](/project/token) Holder: [0xD06777d9b02F677214073cC3C5338904CBa7894a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD06777d9b02F677214073cC3C5338904CBa7894a)

We have not sold and have no plans to sell tokens on the secondary market at this time, and reiterate our commitment that in advance of any selling of tokens, we will publicly share a structured selling plan with the community.

**Upcoming transparency report coverage:**
- Batches Sold and associated Ethereum addresses 
- Burned Tokens from unsold batches
- Allocation from funds associated with interest program, project fund, early investors, liquidity

After our bonding curve we will launch our DAO voting on **snapshot.page**, instead of Aragon because of the current gas situation on ethereum main-net. Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results. Once [our pull request has been merged](https://github.com/bonustrack/snapshot-spaces/pull/18), we will redirect the dao.octo.fi domain to [snapshot.page/#/octofi](https://snapshot.page/#/octofi) and later provide instructions on using the platform.

Also we are happy to now be verified on etherscan and looking forward to the decentralized autonomous future of the OctoFi project.

We keep constantly developing for our community and are happy to share in the next few days the results. As you know we keep everything open source, even the frontend code (most projects just publish the smart contracts) and are GitHub Pages hosted at the moment, because we are looking into P2P hosting without any centralized servers.
