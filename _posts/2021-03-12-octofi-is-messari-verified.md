As an anonymous-led project, we feel it’s important to show the community that [OctoFi](https://octo.fi/) is transparent and that is why we are happy to announce that we have received our [Messari Verification Badge](https://messari.io/registry)!

**Our profile:** [messari.io/asset/octo](https://messari.io/asset/octo)

While we chose to keep our identities secret, OctoFi itself adheres to the open-source ethos and aims to be as transparent as possible. As such, we decided to apply for the Messari badge earlier this year in order to ensure our community and the wider cryptosphere that we are the real deal.

That’s why we’ve chosen Messari, a cryptocurrency data provider and analytics platform that has been on the forefront of cryptocurrency and blockchain education for both retail and institutional audiences. Founded by Ryan Selkis and Dan McArdle, Messari allows its users to access accurate data, analysis, reports and more. 

### What is the Messari Registry?

The Messari Registry is a database containing verified information on selected blockchain projects. Projects are manually vetted by Messari to ensure the information is accurate and up to date which in turn facilitates the due diligence process for multiple parties, including exchanges, wallets, investors, regulators, and developers.

While these types of disclosure processes are commonplace in traditional markets, crypto has often been plagued with lack of reliable information when it comes to project specifics, technology, tokenomics and other important aspects which is why Messari created the  Messari Registry

### Why it's important for us

Earning the Messari Verification Badge will set OctoFi apart from other projects on the website and place it alongside the likes of Aave, Maker, LBRY, Zilliqa, and others, but that’s not all. We want to prove that privacy and anonymity are nothing to be feared. Like anything else in the world, these can be used for good or nefarious purposes. This applies to privacy, technology, etc…

The Messari Registry gives us a chance to prove this to the world, but it’s also a way to showcase the quality of Octofi to a whole different demographic and to bring more people into our community which is growing everyday.
