OctoFi exists because of eight guiding principles. Without them we lose sight of the cypherpunk ethos that birthed a grassroots movement in pursuit of decentralization. We are witnessing the change we all set out to make. So consider this a pledge to see that change through.

## Open-source everything

All of our software is open source and verifiable, and it always will be. We don't ask that you blindly trust our word or anyone else's. Only that you verify our work and hold us accountable.

## Cherish the community

Our community breathe life into the project. They share thoughts, opinions, and feedback. We shall always listen to them, treat them with respect, and foster an environment where they can flourish, and in turn they will help us grow.

## Educate the inquisitive

Those who are willing to learn should be given the tools to do so. We shall share our knowledge with them and give without expectation. Newcomers should feel empowered, not intimidated.

## Always be transparent

Integrity is the holy grail. Without it we are irrelevant and unworthy. We shall dedicate ourselves to transparency in order to provide everyone with ample opportunities to verify. We reside on a truth machine and know very well that those who lie are split in two.

## Say no to surveillance

There is no need nor monetary incentive to productize our users and therefore we shall not track them. If we are to democratize the digital realm we shan't exploit the people who comprise it. We all have a right to privacy and in everything we do we shall honor it.

## Keep the meme alive

This isn't Wall St, there isn't a boardroom, and no way in hell are we in suit and tie. Just because finance is something serious doesn't mean we should take ourselves seriously. While memes make us happy, they're also a stream of consciousness, and the best tool for spreading ideas that has ever been at our disposal. Use them plenty. Use them well.

## Empower the people

Social movements like this don't even come once in a lifetime. They're multi generational, and unlike others before, decentralization is a movement of unprecedented magnitude. So with community in mind, our project belongs to its holders, and they shall reap its rewards.

## Make trust obsolete

You don't need a team to trust. You need to verify their work. This movement is permissionless and trust was never part of the equation. We shall dedicate ourselves to exercising these eight principles, to empower others to participate how was always intended -- as autonomous individuals, sovereign from the broken system before us.
