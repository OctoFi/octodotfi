title: What is OctoFi?

---

**OctoFi gives you cash back** when you transact with the most trusted decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. Earn free crypto. Octomatically. 

Our cashback mechanism is built into: 

1. **<span class="text-span">OctoFi dApp:</span>** an all-in-one decentralized application serving up direct access to a broad range of DeFi and NFT marketplaces from one convenient location.
2. **<span class="text-span">OctoFi Wallet:</span>** a fork of MetaMask with lower built-in swap fees, support for various networks by default, essential NFT features, and removal of all user tracking.
3. **<span class="text-span">OctoFi Token:</span>** an ERC-20 on the Etherum network, OCTO is used to govern the project, unlock exclusive features, and earn your share of revenue.

## ü§î How does it work?

When you transact with any of our [referral partners](/partners) using our wallet, either from our dapp, or directly on their own websites:

- They pay us a share of their revenue as commission
- We pass through 40% to you (if using our wallet)
- The remaining 60% goes to our token holders

If you don't have our wallet installed, you can still connect to and use our dapp with most other popular wallets, but 100% of any commissions generated by your transactions will be directed to our token holders.

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why is this important?

We've witnessed similar value propositions in the $3.9 trillion ecommerce industry with the likes of [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/), who were [acquired by PayPal in 2019 for $4 billion](https://www.pymnts.com/news/partnerships-acquisitions/2020/paypal-finalizes-4-billion-dollar-honey-acquisition/). This model has been replicated by crypto companies such as [Lolli.com](https://lolli.com) who use a portion of their ecommerce referral commissions to reward shoppers with Bitcoin cashbacks.

> Honey and Lolli <span class="text-span">for traders</span> anyone?

But we're crypto native and with over $1 trillion in value settled on the Ethereum alone in 2020, we forsee opportunities for this proven business model to grow exponentially within decentralized finance, collectibles, artworks, exchanges, gambling, gaming, and more!

## ‚è≥ When is it useful?

We endeavour to accelerate growth for our referral partners while embracing a multi-chain future, so it's fair to say every effort is being made to expand [our partner network](/partners) to ensure our products are useful NOW, and well into the future...

- **dApp:** bookmark or install as a progressive web app (PWA) even if you prefer to use another wallet (eg. We direct 2.5% cashback from OpenSea to token holders).
- **Wallet:** simply install it and reap the rewards when using it on our dapp or one of our partner sites (eg. Get 1% cashback when you purchase any NFT on OpenSea).
- **Token:** purchase the OCTO token to gain access to exclusive features, participate in governance, and earn your share of all revenue from the wallet and dapp.

As interoperability and composability shape up to be defining narratives within our industry, many leading projects are supercharging their growth by embracing the affiliate model to establish partner programs -- ecommerce giants like Amazon certainly did; so why wouldn't the *future blue chips of blockchain?*

## üßê Who's behind it?

OctoFi's founding team comprising '[Dr. Octavius](https://t.me/OctoFi_Biz)' and '[Mr. OG](https://t.me/OctoFi_Dev)' have chosen to remain anonymous and have [a number of reasons](/blog/reasons-to-stay-anon-defi-team) for doing so. While their reasoning pertains mostly to decentralization, they've also insisted that "you don't need a team to trust, you need to [verify their work](https://den.octo.fi/t/transparency)." OctoFi exists because of eight guiding principles. Without them we lose sight of the cypherpunk ethos that birthed a grassroots movement in pursuit of decentralization. We are witnessing the change we all set out to make.

> Open source everything, cherish the community, educate the inquisitive, always be transparent, say no to surveillance, keep the meme alive, empower the people, and <span class="text-span">make trust obsolete.</span> 

So consider [The Tentacult Manifesto](/manifesto) a pledge to see that change through. The project is and always will be [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source), meaning that [all of our code](https://github.com/octofi) is public and available for anyone to audit, modify, and use however they like. We have also made a very public commitment to  [complete transparency](https://den.octo.fi/t/transparency) by joining the [Messari Registry](https://messari.io/asset/octo) and have taken all necessary measures to ensure [rug resistance](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x7240aC91f01233BaAf8b064248E80feaA5912BA3?name=Octo.fi&symbol=OCTO).

Furthermore, in March 2021 a council of eight members were elected to steward OctoFi toward fulfilling its vision. Facilitated through a community governance vote, the chosen eight known as *The Octagon,* each became signatories for a five of eight multisignature address holding project reserve funds. An anonymous early backer donated 7000 OCTO to fund each of the following people with a 30 OCTO per month salary for 888 days:

### 3. <span class="text-span">Token</span> ([OCTO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7240ac91f01233baaf8b064248e80feaa5912ba3))

The OCTO token is used to govern the project, unlock exclusive features, and to distribute ALL revenue. You can purchase it on [Uniswap](https://uni.octo.fi) or directly from [OctoFi](https://app.octo.fi/#/swap/uni), but always check the token contract address ([0X7240...2BA3](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7240ac91f01233baaf8b064248e80feaa5912ba3)) first.

Here's what you can do with your $OCTO right now:

| Liquidity Providers | Passive Holders |
|-|-|
| Earn OCTO + USDC ([usdc.octo.fi](https://usdc.octo.fi)) pool fees | Earn share of OctoFi fees |
| Earn OCTO + ETH ([eth.octo.fi](https://eth.octo.fi)) pools fees | Unlock exclusive features |
| Earn OCTO for LP staking ([farm.octo.fi](https://farm.octo.fi))  | Vote on governance decisions |

**Revenue is distributed to holders** proportional to their share of the OCTO circulating supply. Snapshots are taken at 808am UTC on the first and last day of each month to determine whose holdings are eligible for each monthly distribution. Payouts are made in stablecoins directly to eligible wallets (liquidity providers excluded) and do not require staking or claiming (subject to change as L2 solutions become available). 

#### Distribution eligibility

At the end of month snapshot, you must hold the same amount of OCTO, or more, than you did at the start of month snapshot to be eligible. Only those OCTO held for the entire period are deemed eligible and those who HODL are rewarded. Any additional OCTO you've accumulated during a given month will only count towards the next month. 

If the amount of OCTO in your address at the end of month is less than at the beginning, you are disqualified from receiving any payout for that month. Only non-custodial wallets are counted. We do not include exchange wallets.

> Not <span class="text-span">your keys</span>, not your fees.

You can visit [hodl.octo.fi](https://hodl.octo.fi) for an up to date list of eligible addresses. Payouts are made on the 8th of each month and you can visit [fees.octo.fi](https://fees.octo.fi) to track revenue wallet deposits. 

#### Token launch details

OCTO ([0X7240...2BA3](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7240ac91f01233baaf8b064248e80feaa5912ba3)) is an [audited](https://audit.octo.fi) ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network.
